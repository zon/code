### Panic

The usual way to report an error to a caller is to return an `error` as an extra return value.  The canonical `Read` method is a well-known instance; it returns a byte count and an `error`.  But what if the error is unrecoverable?  Sometimes the program simply cannot continue.

For this purpose, there is a built-in function `panic`that in effect creates a run-time error that will stop the program (but see the next section).  The function takes a single argument of arbitrary type—often a string—to be printed as the program dies.  It's also a way to indicate that something impossible has happened, such as exiting an infinite loop.

```
// A toy implementation of cube root using Newton's method.
func CubeRoot(x float64) float64 {
    z := x/3   // Arbitrary initial value
    for i := 0; i < 1e6; i++ {
        prevz := z
        z -= (z*z*z-x) / (3*z*z)
        if veryClose(z, prevz) {
            return z
        }
    }
    // A million iterations has not converged; something is wrong.
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("CubeRoot(%g) did not converge", x))
}

```

This is only an example but real library functions should avoid `panic`.  If the problem can be masked or worked around, it's always better to let things continue to run rather than taking down the whole program.  One possible counterexample is during initialization: if the library truly cannot set itself up, it might be reasonable to panic, so to speak.

```
var user = os.Getenv("USER")

func init() {
    if user == "" {
        panic("no value for $USER")
    }
}

```
