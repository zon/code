### Maps

Maps are a convenient and powerful built-in data structure that associate values of one type (the _key_) with values of another type (the _element_ or _value_). The key can be of any type for which the equality operator is defined, such as integers, floating point and complex numbers, strings, pointers, interfaces (as long as the dynamic type supports equality), structs and arrays. Slices cannot be used as map keys, because equality is not defined on them. Like slices, maps hold references to an underlying data structure. If you pass a map to a function that changes the contents of the map, the changes will be visible in the caller.

Maps can be constructed using the usual composite literal syntax with colon-separated key-value pairs, so it's easy to build them during initialization.

```
var timeZone = map[string]int{
    "UTC":  0*60*60,
    "EST": -5*60*60,
    "CST": -6*60*60,
    "MST": -7*60*60,
    "PST": -8*60*60,
}

```

Assigning and fetching map values looks syntactically just like doing the same for arrays and slices except that the index doesn't need to be an integer.

```
offset := timeZone["EST"]

```

An attempt to fetch a map value with a key that is not present in the map will return the zero value for the type of the entries in the map.  For instance, if the map contains integers, looking up a non-existent key will return `0`. A set can be implemented as a map with value type `bool`. Set the map entry to `true` to put the value in the set, and then test it by simple indexing.

```
attended := map[string]bool{
    "Ann": true,
    "Joe": true,
    ...
}

if attended[person] { // will be false if person is not in the map
    fmt.Println(person, "was at the meeting")
}

```

Sometimes you need to distinguish a missing entry from a zero value.  Is there an entry for `"UTC"`or is that 0 because it's not in the map at all? You can discriminate with a form of multiple assignment.

```
var seconds int
var ok bool
seconds, ok = timeZone[tz]

```

For obvious reasons this is called the “comma ok” idiom. In this example, if `tz` is present, `seconds`will be set appropriately and `ok` will be true; if not, `seconds` will be set to zero and `ok` will be false. Here's a function that puts it together with a nice error report:

```
func offset(tz string) int {
    if seconds, ok := timeZone[tz]; ok {
        return seconds
    }
    log.Println("unknown time zone:", tz)
    return 0
}

```

To test for presence in the map without worrying about the actual value, you can use the blank identifier ( `_`) in place of the usual variable for the value.

```
_, present := timeZone[tz]

```

To delete a map entry, use the `delete`built-in function, whose arguments are the map and the key to be deleted. It's safe to do this even if the key is already absent from the map.

```
delete(timeZone, "PDT")  // Now on Standard Time

```
