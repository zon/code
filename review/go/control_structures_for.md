### For

The Go `for` loop is similar to—but not the same as—C's. It unifies `for`and `while` and there is no `do-while`. There are three forms, only one of which has semicolons.

```
// Like a C for
for init; condition; post { }

// Like a C while
for condition { }

// Like a C for(;;)
for { }

```

Short declarations make it easy to declare the index variable right in the loop.

```
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    sum += i
}

```

If you're looping over an array, slice, string, or map, or reading from a channel, a `range` clause can manage the loop.

```
for key, value := range oldMap {
    newMap[key] = value
}

```

If you only need the first item in the range (the key or index), drop the second:

```
for key := range m {
    if key.expired() {
        delete(m, key)
    }
}

```

If you only need the second item in the range (the value), use the _blank identifier_, an underscore, to discard the first:

```
sum := 0
for _, value := range array {
    sum += value
}

```

The blank identifier has many uses, as described in a later section.

For strings, the `range` does more work for you, breaking out individual Unicode code points by parsing the UTF-8. Erroneous encodings consume one byte and produce the replacement rune U+FFFD. (The name (with associated builtin type) `rune` is Go terminology for a single Unicode code point. See the language specificationfor details.) The loop

```
for pos, char := range "日本\x80語" { // \x80 is an illegal UTF-8 encoding
    fmt.Printf("character %#U starts at byte position %d\n", char, pos)
}

```

prints

```
character U+65E5 '日' starts at byte position 0
character U+672C '本' starts at byte position 3
character U+FFFD '' starts at byte position 6
character U+8A9E '語' starts at byte position 7

```

Finally, Go has no comma operator and `++` and `--`are statements not expressions. Thus if you want to run multiple variables in a `for`you should use parallel assignment (although that precludes `++` and `--`).

```
// Reverse a
for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
}

```
