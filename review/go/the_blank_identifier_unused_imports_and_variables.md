### Unused imports and variables

It is an error to import a package or to declare a variable without using it. Unused imports bloat the program and slow compilation, while a variable that is initialized but not used is at least a wasted computation and perhaps indicative of a larger bug. When a program is under active development, however, unused imports and variables often arise and it can be annoying to delete them just to have the compilation proceed, only to have them be needed again later. The blank identifier provides a workaround.

This half-written program has two unused imports ( `fmt` and `io`) and an unused variable ( `fd`), so it will not compile, but it would be nice to see if the code so far is correct.

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open("test.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // TODO: use fd.
}

```

To silence complaints about the unused imports, use a blank identifier to refer to a symbol from the imported package. Similarly, assigning the unused variable `fd`to the blank identifier will silence the unused variable error. This version of the program does compile.

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

var _ = fmt.Printf // For debugging; delete when done.
var _ io.Reader    // For debugging; delete when done.

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open("test.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // TODO: use fd.
    _ = fd
}

```

By convention, the global declarations to silence import errors should come right after the imports and be commented, both to make them easy to find and as a reminder to clean things up later.
