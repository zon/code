### If

In Go a simple `if` looks like this:

```
if x > 0 {
    return y
}

```

Mandatory braces encourage writing simple `if` statements on multiple lines.  It's good style to do so anyway, especially when the body contains a control statement such as a `return` or `break`.

Since `if` and `switch` accept an initialization statement, it's common to see one used to set up a local variable.

```
if err := file.Chmod(0664); err != nil {
    log.Print(err)
    return err
}

```

In the Go libraries, you'll find that when an `if` statement doesn't flow into the next statement—that is, the body ends in `break`, `continue`, `goto`, or `return`—the unnecessary `else` is omitted.

```
f, err := os.Open(name)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
codeUsing(f)

```

This is an example of a common situation where code must guard against a sequence of error conditions.  The code reads well if the successful flow of control runs down the page, eliminating error cases as they arise.  Since error cases tend to end in `return`statements, the resulting code needs no `else` statements.

```
f, err := os.Open(name)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
d, err := f.Stat()
if err != nil {
    f.Close()
    return err
}
codeUsing(f, d)

```
