### Interfaces and methods

Since almost anything can have methods attached, almost anything can satisfy an interface.  One illustrative example is in the `http`package, which defines the `Handler` interface.  Any object that implements `Handler` can serve HTTP requests.

```
type Handler interface {
    ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}

```

`ResponseWriter` is itself an interface that provides access to the methods needed to return the response to the client. Those methods include the standard `Write` method, so an `http.ResponseWriter` can be used wherever an `io.Writer`can be used. `Request` is a struct containing a parsed representation of the request from the client.

For brevity, let's ignore POSTs and assume HTTP requests are always GETs; that simplification does not affect the way the handlers are set up. Here's a trivial implementation of a handler to count the number of times the page is visited.

```
// Simple counter server.
type Counter struct {
    n int
}

func (ctr *Counter) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    ctr.n++
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "counter = %d\n", ctr.n)
}

```

(Keeping with our theme, note how `Fprintf` can print to an `http.ResponseWriter`.) In a real server, access to `ctr.n` would need protection from concurrent access. See the `sync` and `atomic` packages for suggestions.

For reference, here's how to attach such a server to a node on the URL tree.

```
import "net/http"
...
ctr := new(Counter)
http.Handle("/counter", ctr)

```

But why make `Counter` a struct?  An integer is all that's needed. (The receiver needs to be a pointer so the increment is visible to the caller.)

```
// Simpler counter server.
type Counter int

func (ctr *Counter) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    *ctr++
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "counter = %d\n", *ctr)
}

```

What if your program has some internal state that needs to be notified that a page has been visited?  Tie a channel to the web page.

```
// A channel that sends a notification on each visit.
// (Probably want the channel to be buffered.)
type Chan chan *http.Request

func (ch Chan) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    ch <- req
    fmt.Fprint(w, "notification sent")
}

```

Finally, let's say we wanted to present on `/args` the arguments used when invoking the server binary. It's easy to write a function to print the arguments.

```
func ArgServer() {
    fmt.Println(os.Args)
}

```

How do we turn that into an HTTP server?  We could make `ArgServer`a method of some type whose value we ignore, but there's a cleaner way. Since we can define a method for any type except pointers and interfaces, we can write a method for a function. The `http` package contains this code:

```
// The HandlerFunc type is an adapter to allow the use of
// ordinary functions as HTTP handlers.  If f is a function
// with the appropriate signature, HandlerFunc(f) is a
// Handler object that calls f.
type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)

// ServeHTTP calls f(w, req).
func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, req *Request) {
    f(w, req)
}

```

`HandlerFunc` is a type with a method, `ServeHTTP`, so values of that type can serve HTTP requests.  Look at the implementation of the method: the receiver is a function, `f`, and the method calls `f`.  That may seem odd but it's not that different from, say, the receiver being a channel and the method sending on the channel.

To make `ArgServer` into an HTTP server, we first modify it to have the right signature.

```
// Argument server.
func ArgServer(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, os.Args)
}

```

`ArgServer` now has the same signature as `HandlerFunc`, so it can be converted to that type to access its methods, just as we converted `Sequence` to `IntSlice`to access `IntSlice.Sort`. The code to set it up is concise:

```
http.Handle("/args", http.HandlerFunc(ArgServer))

```

When someone visits the page `/args`, the handler installed at that page has value `ArgServer`and type `HandlerFunc`. The HTTP server will invoke the method `ServeHTTP`of that type, with `ArgServer` as the receiver, which will in turn call `ArgServer` (via the invocation `f(w, req)`inside `HandlerFunc.ServeHTTP`). The arguments will then be displayed.

In this section we have made an HTTP server from a struct, an integer, a channel, and a function, all because interfaces are just sets of methods, which can be defined for (almost) any type.
