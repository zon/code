### Defer

Go's `defer` statement schedules a function call (the deferred function) to be run immediately before the function executing the `defer` returns.  It's an unusual but effective way to deal with situations such as resources that must be released regardless of which path a function takes to return.  The canonical examples are unlocking a mutex or closing a file.

```
// Contents returns the file's contents as a string.
func Contents(filename string) (string, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer f.Close()  // f.Close will run when we're finished.

    var result []byte
    buf := make([]byte, 100)
    for {
        n, err := f.Read(buf[0:])
        result = append(result, buf[0:n]...) // append is discussed later.
        if err != nil {
            if err == io.EOF {
                break
            }
            return "", err  // f will be closed if we return here.
        }
    }
    return string(result), nil // f will be closed if we return here.
}

```

Deferring a call to a function such as `Close` has two advantages.  First, it guarantees that you will never forget to close the file, a mistake that's easy to make if you later edit the function to add a new return path.  Second, it means that the close sits near the open, which is much clearer than placing it at the end of the function.

The arguments to the deferred function (which include the receiver if the function is a method) are evaluated when the deferexecutes, not when the call executes.  Besides avoiding worries about variables changing values as the function executes, this means that a single deferred call site can defer multiple function executions.  Here's a silly example.

```
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    defer fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
}

```

Deferred functions are executed in LIFO order, so this code will cause `4 3 2 1 0` to be printed when the function returns.  A more plausible example is a simple way to trace function execution through the program.  We could write a couple of simple tracing routines like this:

```
func trace(s string)   { fmt.Println("entering:", s) }
func untrace(s string) { fmt.Println("leaving:", s) }

// Use them like this:
func a() {
    trace("a")
    defer untrace("a")
    // do something....
}

```

We can do better by exploiting the fact that arguments to deferred functions are evaluated when the `defer` executes.  The tracing routine can set up the argument to the untracing routine. This example:

```
func trace(s string) string {
    fmt.Println("entering:", s)
    return s
}

func un(s string) {
    fmt.Println("leaving:", s)
}

func a() {
    defer un(trace("a"))
    fmt.Println("in a")
}

func b() {
    defer un(trace("b"))
    fmt.Println("in b")
    a()
}

func main() {
    b()
}

```

prints

```
entering: b
in b
entering: a
in a
leaving: a
leaving: b

```

For programmers accustomed to block-level resource management from other languages, `defer` may seem peculiar, but its most interesting and powerful applications come precisely from the fact that it's not block-based but function-based.  In the section on `panic` and `recover` we'll see another example of its possibilities.
