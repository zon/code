### A leaky buffer

The tools of concurrent programming can even make non-concurrent ideas easier to express.  Here's an example abstracted from an RPC package.  The client goroutine loops receiving data from some source, perhaps a network.  To avoid allocating and freeing buffers, it keeps a free list, and uses a buffered channel to represent it.  If the channel is empty, a new buffer gets allocated. Once the message buffer is ready, it's sent to the server on `serverChan`.

```
var freeList = make(chan *Buffer, 100)
var serverChan = make(chan *Buffer)

func client() {
    for {
        var b *Buffer
        // Grab a buffer if available; allocate if not.
        select {
        case b = <-freeList:
            // Got one; nothing more to do.
        default:
            // None free, so allocate a new one.
            b = new(Buffer)
        }
        load(b)              // Read next message from the net.
        serverChan <- b      // Send to server.
    }
}

```

The server loop receives each message from the client, processes it, and returns the buffer to the free list.

```
func server() {
    for {
        b := <-serverChan    // Wait for work.
        process(b)
        // Reuse buffer if there's room.
        select {
        case freeList <- b:
            // Buffer on free list; nothing more to do.
        default:
            // Free list full, just carry on.
        }
    }
}

```

The client attempts to retrieve a buffer from `freeList`; if none is available, it allocates a fresh one. The server's send to `freeList` puts `b` back on the free list unless the list is full, in which case the buffer is dropped on the floor to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. (The `default` clauses in the `select`statements execute when no other case is ready, meaning that the `selects` never block.) This implementation builds a leaky bucket free list in just a few lines, relying on the buffered channel and the garbage collector for bookkeeping.
