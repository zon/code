## Errors

Library routines must often return some sort of error indication to the caller. As mentioned earlier, Go's multivalue return makes it easy to return a detailed error description alongside the normal return value. It is good style to use this feature to provide detailed error information. For example, as we'll see, `os.Open` doesn't just return a `nil` pointer on failure, it also returns an error value that describes what went wrong.

By convention, errors have type `error`, a simple built-in interface.

```
type error interface {
    Error() string
}

```

A library writer is free to implement this interface with a richer model under the covers, making it possible not only to see the error but also to provide some context. As mentioned, alongside the usual `*os.File`return value, `os.Open` also returns an error value. If the file is opened successfully, the error will be `nil`, but when there is a problem, it will hold an `os.PathError`:

```
// PathError records an error and the operation and
// file path that caused it.
type PathError struct {
    Op string    // "open", "unlink", etc.
    Path string  // The associated file.
    Err error    // Returned by the system call.
}

func (e *PathError) Error() string {
    return e.Op + " " + e.Path + ": " + e.Err.Error()
}

```

`PathError`'s `Error` generates a string like this:

```
open /etc/passwx: no such file or directory

```

Such an error, which includes the problematic file name, the operation, and the operating system error it triggered, is useful even if printed far from the call that caused it; it is much more informative than the plain "no such file or directory".

When feasible, error strings should identify their origin, such as by having a prefix naming the operation or package that generated the error.  For example, in package `image`, the string representation for a decoding error due to an unknown format is "image: unknown format".

Callers that care about the precise error details can use a type switch or a type assertion to look for specific errors and extract details.  For `PathErrors`this might include examining the internal `Err`field for recoverable failures.

```
for try := 0; try < 2; try++ {
    file, err = os.Create(filename)
    if err == nil {
        return
    }
    if e, ok := err.(*os.PathError); ok && e.Err == syscall.ENOSPC {
        deleteTempFiles()  // Recover some space.
        continue
    }
    return
}

```

The second `if` statement here is another type assertion. If it fails, `ok` will be false, and `e`will be `nil`. If it succeeds,  `ok` will be true, which means the error was of type `*os.PathError`, and then so is `e`, which we can examine for more information about the error.
