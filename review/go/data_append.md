### Append

Now we have the missing piece we needed to explain the design of the `append` built-in function.  The signature of `append`is different from our custom `Append` function above. Schematically, it's like this:

```
func append(slice []T, elements ...T) []T

```

where T is a placeholder for any given type.  You can't actually write a function in Go where the type `T`is determined by the caller. That's why `append` is built in: it needs support from the compiler.

What `append` does is append the elements to the end of the slice and return the result.  The result needs to be returned because, as with our hand-written `Append`, the underlying array may change.  This simple example

```
x := []int{1,2,3}
x = append(x, 4, 5, 6)
fmt.Println(x)

```

prints `[1 2 3 4 5 6]`.  So `append` works a little like `Printf`, collecting an arbitrary number of arguments.

But what if we wanted to do what our `Append` does and append a slice to a slice?  Easy: use `...` at the call site, just as we did in the call to `Output` above.  This snippet produces identical output to the one above.

```
x := []int{1,2,3}
y := []int{4,5,6}
x = append(x, y...)
fmt.Println(x)

```

Without that `...`, it wouldn't compile because the types would be wrong; `y` is not of type `int`.
