### Slices

Slices wrap arrays to give a more general, powerful, and convenient interface to sequences of data.  Except for items with explicit dimension such as transformation matrices, most array programming in Go is done with slices rather than simple arrays.

Slices hold references to an underlying array, and if you assign one slice to another, both refer to the same array. If a function takes a slice argument, changes it makes to the elements of the slice will be visible to the caller, analogous to passing a pointer to the underlying array.  A `Read`function can therefore accept a slice argument rather than a pointer and a count; the length within the slice sets an upper limit of how much data to read.  Here is the signature of the `Read` method of the `File` type in package `os`:

```
func (f *File) Read(buf []byte) (n int, err error)

```

The method returns the number of bytes read and an error value, if any. To read into the first 32 bytes of a larger buffer `buf`, slice (here used as a verb) the buffer.

```
    n, err := f.Read(buf[0:32])

```

Such slicing is common and efficient.  In fact, leaving efficiency aside for the moment, the following snippet would also read the first 32 bytes of the buffer.

```
    var n int
    var err error
    for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
        nbytes, e := f.Read(buf[i:i+1])  // Read one byte.
        n += nbytes
        if nbytes == 0 || e != nil {
            err = e
            break
        }
    }

```

The length of a slice may be changed as long as it still fits within the limits of the underlying array; just assign it to a slice of itself.  The capacity of a slice, accessible by the built-in function `cap`, reports the maximum length the slice may assume.  Here is a function to append data to a slice.  If the data exceeds the capacity, the slice is reallocated.  The resulting slice is returned.  The function uses the fact that `len` and `cap` are legal when applied to the `nil` slice, and return 0.

```
func Append(slice, data []byte) []byte {
    l := len(slice)
    if l + len(data) > cap(slice) {  // reallocate
        // Allocate double what's needed, for future growth.
        newSlice := make([]byte, (l+len(data))*2)
        // The copy function is predeclared and works for any slice type.
        copy(newSlice, slice)
        slice = newSlice
    }
    slice = slice[0:l+len(data)]
    copy(slice[l:], data)
    return slice
}

```

We must return the slice afterwards because, although `Append`can modify the elements of `slice`, the slice itself (the run-time data structure holding the pointer, length, and capacity) is passed by value.

The idea of appending to a slice is so useful it's captured by the `append` built-in function.  To understand that function's design, though, we need a little more information, so we'll return to it later.
