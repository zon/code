### Named result parameters

The return or result "parameters" of a Go function can be given names and used as regular variables, just like the incoming parameters. When named, they are initialized to the zero values for their types when the function begins; if the function executes a `return` statement with no arguments, the current values of the result parameters are used as the returned values.

The names are not mandatory but they can make code shorter and clearer: they're documentation. If we name the results of `nextInt` it becomes obvious which returned `int`is which.

```
func nextInt(b []byte, pos int) (value, nextPos int) {

```

Because named results are initialized and tied to an unadorned return, they can simplify as well as clarify.  Here's a version of `io.ReadFull` that uses them well:

```
func ReadFull(r Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error) {
    for len(buf) > 0 && err == nil {
        var nr int
        nr, err = r.Read(buf)
        n += nr
        buf = buf[nr:]
    }
    return
}

```
