### Channels of channels

One of the most important properties of Go is that a channel is a first-class value that can be allocated and passed around like any other.  A common use of this property is to implement safe, parallel demultiplexing.

In the example in the previous section, `handle` was an idealized handler for a request but we didn't define the type it was handling.  If that type includes a channel on which to reply, each client can provide its own path for the answer. Here's a schematic definition of type `Request`.

```
type Request struct {
    args        []int
    f           func([]int) int
    resultChan  chan int
}

```

The client provides a function and its arguments, as well as a channel inside the request object on which to receive the answer.

```
func sum(a []int) (s int) {
    for _, v := range a {
        s += v
    }
    return
}

request := &Request{[]int{3, 4, 5}, sum, make(chan int)}
// Send request
clientRequests <- request
// Wait for response.
fmt.Printf("answer: %d\n", <-request.resultChan)

```

On the server side, the handler function is the only thing that changes.

```
func handle(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        req.resultChan <- req.f(req.args)
    }
}

```

There's clearly a lot more to do to make it realistic, but this code is a framework for a rate-limited, parallel, non-blocking RPC system, and there's not a mutex in sight.
